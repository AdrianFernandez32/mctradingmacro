## How to use macro
### Gameplay positioning
1. Align yourself with the middle of the block that't under you

2. Align your cursor with the last pixel of the block in front of you, but make sure of not touching the iron trapdoor

3. Place the lectern and wait 'till the villager gets the job

4. Make sure to not move your mouse, you can use `Alt + Tab` to switch to the .exe file
### Start macro
When executing the .exe file, this UI will Pop-up

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a319bbb5-278e-4393-9806-2c63702fb789)
- There you can choose what kind of axe and enchanments you will be using
- Stop key is the key you want to assign for stopping the loop
- Delay is how much time you want to see the enchanments. Make sure to chose a perfect time, you don't want to lose a good enchanment.

Now you can start the macro. When starting, you'll have 3 seconds to switch to the minecraft window, make sure to use `Alt + Tab`.
## Important
When stopping the macro, it has to finish the loop for stopping completly. So **DON'T PANIC**, once you find the perfect enchantment, press the stop key and wait 'till the macro closes the villagers menu.
